## We want a website that contains information about goalkeepers. This information can be summarised in several key characteristics, including club, number of Goals, number of clean sheets, number of goals scored, number of yellow cards, number of red cards, and number of matches played in all seasons. 
 So I found a perfect website,  it has all we want, but it has a small problem, it is not organised, but  I think it is perfect.

task 2 
Initially, I put the data into DuckDB and wanted to clean it completely, but SQL encountered some problems. When I looked at what you did, I saw that you used Pandas to clean it, so I did the same.

So ,
I deleted the columns related to goalkeepers, then replaced the NULLS in the missing data with zeros, and renamed the columns to be compatible with SQL and easier to understand.

After that, I saved it as a CSV file and uploaded it for you named player_fact_clean.
That's all.
